# Design Rationale (Paper ↔ Code Alignment)

This repository mirrors a **CS/AI systems paper**:

- Simulator → *Experimental Setup / Data Generator*
- Baselines + fairness post-processing → *Baselines*
- ECL → *Method: constraint-based governance layer*
- Pareto + MAS → *Multi-objective evaluation & selection*
- Reporting/export → *Results + reproducibility*
- Streamlit UI → *Calibration + reviewer demo*

The goal is to ensure every claim in the paper is backed by executable, reproducible code.
